## ------------------------- Clawpack examples ----------------------
##
## Hyperbolic problems using Clawpack 4.6 and 5.0 
## 
## Many of these examples have been taken from the original 
## Clawpack software package, developed by R. J. LeVeque, 
## and many others. (www.clawpack.org)
## 
## For descriptions of the wave propagation algorithm used 
## in Clawpack, see :

## --------------------- Advection on the sphere ---------------------------- 
## Examples from suite described by Lauritzen, et al.  See:
##   "A standard test case suite for two-dimensional  linear
##    transport on the sphere: results from a collection 
##    of state-of-the-art schemes", Lauritzen, et al.

## ---------------------------- Transport --------------------------------- 
## Example : Solve the variable velocity transport equation
##
##                   q_t + div(u q) = 0
##
## These examples use the fwave approach and can be used to test
## conservation.

## ------------------------- Simple example -------------------------------- 
## Example : Don't using the 'app' for configuring options;  
##           This is how you might call ForestClaw from another
##           program.
